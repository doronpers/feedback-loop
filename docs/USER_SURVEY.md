# feedback-loop User Survey

**Help us understand YOUR motivations and improve the tool for diverse users**

---

## Why This Survey?

We believe developers learn differently, work differently, and succeed differently. This survey helps us understand:
- What brings YOU to this tool (your motivations)
- How YOU actually use it (not how we think you should)
- What brings YOU fulfillment (not just feature usage)
- How we can better support YOUR path to excellence

**Time**: 5-7 minutes  
**Privacy**: Responses are anonymous unless you choose to share contact info  
**Impact**: Directly shapes future development and documentation
