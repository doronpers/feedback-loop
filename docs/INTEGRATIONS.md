# Integrations

This page summarizes how to connect feedback-loop with common developer workflows.

## GitHub Actions (CI)

- See **Continuous Feedback via GitHub Actions** in `IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS.md` for the full workflow and PR comment behavior.
- See the **GitHub Actions Example** in `METRICS_GUIDE.md` for a copy-paste workflow recipe.

## Pre-commit hook (local Git)

- Use the **Pre-commit Hook** example in `docs/METRICS_GUIDE.md` to analyze patterns before each commit.

## Desktop launchers

- Quick-start GUI launchers are documented in `DESKTOP_LAUNCHERS.md`.

## VS Code / Cursor (LSP)

- The VS Code extension POC and language server setup are described in `vscode-extension/README.md`.
- Cursor is VS Code–based, so the same setup applies there.
