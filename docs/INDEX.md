   - Full 6-stage development workflow
   - All 9 patterns with detailed examples
   - Multi-agent orchestration

   - Prompt engineering techniques
   - **Note**: This is comprehensive (~2700 lines). Use Quick Reference for lookups.

4. **[Metrics Guide](METRICS_GUIDE.md)** ← Automated learning
   - Metrics collection system
   - Pattern analysis and detection
   - AI code generation integration
   - CI/CD workflows
   - Customization guide

5. **[FastAPI Guide](FASTAPI_GUIDE.md)** ← Large file handling
   - Streaming file uploads (800MB+)

   - Security scan results
   - Implementation checklist

9. **[Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md)** ← Version history
   - Release notes
   - Breaking changes
   - Feature additions

## Community & Feedback

## Principles

This documentation embraces diverse learning styles:

- **Multiple entry points**: Choose where to start based on YOUR goals
- **Non-linear navigation**: Jump between docs as curiosity leads
- **Personalized paths**: Support different learning styles equally
- **No "right" way**: Use what works for you, skip what doesn't

Traditional documentation principles also apply:
- **Understandable**: Clear hierarchy and navigation
- **Minimal**: No redundancy, focused content
- **Honest**: All code examples work as shown
- **Thorough**: Complete coverage of features
- **Unobtrusive**: Find what you need quickly
